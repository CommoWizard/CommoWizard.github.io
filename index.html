			My name is Brandon
		</h1>
		
		<p>
			I am a current Network Management student at Wake Technical Community College, recently leaving Active Duty from the United States Army. I enjoy learning how to code within different languages, as well as how to reverse-engineer that code to fully understand what it does and how it works. I often find myself learning code in my free time however, I do enjoy playing guitar, working on my vehicle, and playing PC games.
